## **Overview**

At PwC Switzerland, we are committed to driving innovation through technology and empowering our people to leverage digital tools. Our goal is to differentiate ourselves in the market by digitizing our business processes and enabling our teams to create efficient, growth-oriented, and innovative solutions.

As part of this strategy, we’ve invested in upskilling initiatives that train our employees in areas such as automation, data visualization, data cleansing, and more. By learning to use these tools, our employees can solve common challenges, improve efficiency, and drive innovation within Business Services and beyond.  

With over 2,400 bots already created to automate workflows, we continue to invest in cutting-edge tools like **Power BI**, **machine learning**, and eventually **artificial intelligence (AI)**. These advancements are pivotal in helping us solve problems faster and deliver impactful solutions for our clients.

This is where our **Digital Accelerator Programme** plays a crucial role. The programme equips employees with essential technology skills in automation, machine learning, design thinking, and digital storytelling. As part of this initiative, Power BI has emerged as a key tool for visualizing data and enabling better decision-making for both internal teams and clients.
